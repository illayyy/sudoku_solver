# sudoku_solver
a program capable of generating sudoku puzzles at differing sizes and levels of difficulty (using an external library) and solving them using backtracking and recursion

note: currently program is only optimized up to sudoku puzzles of size 5 or less. any higher and the program takes an unreasonable amount of time to generate a solution to the puzzle.
      looking into a fix.
